# How to contribute
Fork, commit, make pull request! Please make a new branch when adding features.

All contributors are welcome, but keep in mind that all final features will be reviewed with several things in mind:
 - Features should be intentional, nessasary to the program's ultimate use case. A text editor doesn't need automatic git message generation.
  - Standards: KISS (Keep it simple, stupid), UNIX Standard (primarily "do one thing, and do it well")
