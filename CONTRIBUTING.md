# How to contribute
Fork, commit, make pull request! Please make a new branch when adding features.

All contributors are welcome, but keep in mind that all final features will be reviewed with several things in mind:
 - Features should be intentional, nessasary to the program's ultimate use case. A text editor doesn't need automatic git message generation.
   - Standards: KISS (Keep it simple, stupid), UNIX Standard (primarily "do one thing, and do it well")
 - Git commit messages should be descriptive, and under the 50 character limit. 
   - Good example: `Improve event handling logic of GTK buttons` (44 characters, descriptive of additions)
   - Bad example: `fix stuff with buttons` (22 characters, not helpful in retrospect)
 -
